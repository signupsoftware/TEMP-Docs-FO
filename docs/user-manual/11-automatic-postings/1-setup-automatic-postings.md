### Separate suggest approvers from validate

Approving invoices in the external web can take a long time. This is most often due to the "suggest approver" functionality, that is when the system tries to create a new approval chain using advanced logic.

The purpose of this solution is to speed up the handling of invoices in the external web. The solution makes it possible to run the "suggest approver" logic separated from validation when using the web app.

ExFlow \| Setup \| Parameters\| General![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](@site/static/img/media/image61.png)

To turn on the logic a record must be present in;

ExFlow \| Setup \| Resources\| Setup for automatic postings\| Separate suggest approver from validate. In the account code you can use Table, Group or All.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](@site/static/img/media/image62.png)

When the user approves invoice lines in the external web, information is written in tables in D365FO so the system will know which lines will be handled at a later stage. If this is the last line to be approved, the invoice status is set to "Unprocessed".

![](@site/static/img/media/image63.png)

Every line that is to be run in the "suggest approver" (see below) has been marked with status "Waiting" in the two forms that show ExFlow invoices (Document table list page and Document table).

Navigate to: Exflow \| Periodic tasks \| Miscellaneous \| Suggest approvers after validate.

Once approved the dialog - the invoice status changes to Approved.
