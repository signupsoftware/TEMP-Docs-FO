ExFlow \| Setup \| Resources \| Connect \| Rule group \| Translations

For each rule group there is a possibility to set up "Translations". This will specify an incoming field and translate/convert the incoming value to a begin/end/exist function.

Table and field name values for each rule will be dependent on Query that is set up for rule.
Translation values can be the following:
- Starting with a certain value taken from a certain field.
- Ending with a certain value taken from a certain field.
- Containing a certain value taken from a certain field.
- Replacing an incoming value to another value in a certain field.
