For purchase order invoices and when invoice line details are provided, ExFlow will attempt to identify which purchase order line the invoice line is for. If no particular setup is done, this activity will be performed in a priority order set in code.

When desired, the priority order can be configured using the Connect feature available in ExFlow Setup. Settings in this form in conjunction with the underlying forms, will determine how the purchase order connection is performed for specific vendors.
