### Process
**Reject and Archive Button in Import form:**  The new "reject and archive" button in the import form can be seen when archive functionality is enabled. This button allows users to archive invoices directly from the import form, provided they are the invoice owner.

The rejection code and free text must be provided when archiving an invoice. This requirement ensures that there is a clear and documented reason for each archived invoice.
