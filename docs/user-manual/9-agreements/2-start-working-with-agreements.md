1. Set the Parameters for Agreements, see ExFlow - Setup - Parameters - Tab Approval.
2. If needed, setup the approval Workflow (ExFlow workflow for agreement approval). If you are using the workflow for approval of agreements the users need to have the security role "ExFlow agreement manager role" assigned.
