When a new customer is signed and contracted, a deployable package for ExFlow can be distributed.

### Upgrades
Request a new deployable or code package, consider Releases and License Keys. New releases might have new license management.

### Customizations
Having customizations could give consequences & impacts. When upgrading ExFlow or D365 to a newer release, existing customizations must be evaluated and classified. They can becomeâ€¦

* Obsolete - often due to change of requirements or covered by standard functionality.

* Required for upgrade - managed within upgrade project to secure existing functionality in new version.

* Re-designed - the original design and implementation is not applicable anymore. New design and development needs to be defined. SignUp cannot guarantee a solution if the new release of the product don't support the compatibility.

### Migrations
SignUp Softwares can support with migrations of invoice images from one ExFlow release to another. This is only applicable when moving from one AX version to another, e.g. AX2009->AX2012 or AX2012->Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. It is not needed when upgradring ExFlow itself within same AX release.

Please contact SignUp Software if you need support migrating invoices images.

### License Keys
For customer and partner installations (also includes demo environments) of ExFlow, a specific license is required. How to generate licenses depend on which versions of D365 and ExFlow release is used. 

See details below for how licensing works and what information is needed.

If you need a license, please first make sure contract or an agreement is made with sales/account manager at SignUp Software. 

Then submit a support ticket with the needed information (in plain text) enclosed to acquire the license.
