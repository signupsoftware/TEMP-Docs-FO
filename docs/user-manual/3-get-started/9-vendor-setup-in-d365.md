## Vendor default offset account 
<button class="pdf-button" onClick={() => { print(); }}>Save as PDF</button>

To set up in the Default account section, navigate to;
 
Accounts payable \| Vendors \| All vendors \| Invoice tab \| Set up \| Default account. 

You have the option to select one of the accounts as the default account, but it is not mandatory. 
If you set a default account using the 'Set default' button, the 'Default account' will automatically be populated on the imported invoice lines for the specific vendor.

In case you have set a default account but want to use a different vendor default offset account from the available options, you can delete the value in the account field and then click on the lookup button. 
The lookup function will filter the selectable accounts and display only those marked as 'Selectable' for the specific vendor.
 
If no default account is set, the Offset account field will not suggest any accounts.
