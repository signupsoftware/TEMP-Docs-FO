### Subscriptions

This is where you set up your subscriptions (as described previously). Here you can also find information about your subscriptions, such as your previously billed invoices and future billings. <br/>

### Document statistics
ExFlow Core | Common | Document statistics
 
Here you can find the billed invoices that have been sent or received for the different subscriptions and their time frame.<br/>

### Communication log
ExFlow Core | Inquiries | Communication log
 
The communication log logs all the communication between F&O and the Pagero Network. If you receive an error message it can be retrieved from the log. This is a great tool for troubleshooting the flow. It will show the data you send and receive from the API when running the flow and in case anything has gone wrong it will mark it with an error.<br/>
