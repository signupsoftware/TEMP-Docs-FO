## Periodic jobs <button class="pdf-button" onClick={() => { print(); }}>Save as PDF</button>

All the periodic jobs can be set up as standard batch jobs which can run with recurrence or can be manually run by clicking the menu item. The setup of these depends on the company's internal work processes. For example, the "Import vendor invoices" job is always set up to run every 10 minutes, but the periodic job "Posting of vendor invoices" can be processed manually with the benefit of having the clerk manually push 'post' for each invoice, instead of having all invoices that are correct and validated posted at once.
