ExFlow \| Periodic tasks \| Maintenance \| Upgrade invoice image for historical data

If ExFlow have been used in older versions of Dynamics AX and the client want to export ExFlow invoice images an XPO needs to be added to the older AX version to export the supported files to D365, this function allows you to import an Excel sheet with voucher numbers and the name of the invoice PDF file. This is necessary since D365 cannot be reached by file location, and FTP site is used for this function. This function should only be used together with a consultant from SignUp Software AB or your partner.
