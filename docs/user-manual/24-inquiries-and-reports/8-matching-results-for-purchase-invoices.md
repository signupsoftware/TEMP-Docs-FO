ExFlow \| Inquiries and reports \| Matching results for purchase invoices

This form is used to display and export purchase order match results to excel to be used for following up and gaining an oversite for each vendors matching result. For example, you can follow up if all vendor X invoices always get price difference, then maybe the trade agreement is wrongly setup.
