ExFlow \| Inquiries and reports \| Invoice history and matching details

This is a menu item to enable a standard form that displays purchase orders connected to invoices. For example, if a purchase order invoice has been posted and an error has occurred, the invoice will get the status 'pending' and can "locked", meaning it cannot be linked against another invoice. From this form, the link between the purchase order and the invoice can be deleted. This does not mean that the invoice or purchase order itself is deleted - just the link. As soon as the purchase order posting form is opened again and filled with data, the link is created again.
