This is a job that sends out the ExFlow Status report to approvers based on the email broadcast functionality. It is a more advanced email setup functionality than the previous one. Both functions can work side by side serving different purposes. This job is dependent on the standard email batch job running and ExFlow uses the setup used in standard.
