ExFlow \| Setup \| Import methods

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](@site/static/img/media/image22.png)

This form is used for setting up methods of importing invoice data and images into ExFlow, allowing more than one transport method per company. They are run by the separate batch job "Import invoice XML files (Multiple methods)".

This means that both the standard import setup in ExFlow parameters can be used in combination with multiple import methods. ExFlow also supports PEPPOL, OIOUBL formats.
