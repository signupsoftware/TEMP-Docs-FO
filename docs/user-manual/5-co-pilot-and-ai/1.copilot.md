## Copilot and AI
<button class="pdf-button" onClick={() => { print(); }}>Save as PDF</button>

We have improved and added new options for the Machine Learning service and functions within ExFlow AP and ExFlow Web.<br/>
From ExFlow release 2.16 we have introduced ExFlow Copilot, including Copilot Summaries on ExFlow AP forms,<br/> 
such as the import form and the document form.<br/>
ExFlow Copilot is developed to provide additional status and insights and a consistent look and feel for end-users.<br/>
This first version will be released as a separate module.<br/>

### Description of the functionality
The purpose of the form summaries is to provide a quick at-glance check to keep track of important data. It's use-cases includes continuous comparison against KPIs for AP personnel, actionable reminders that shows missing info, and to relieve workload by gathering many of the most important information in the same read-friendly prompt, such as last action performed on an invoice, with the help of AI-functionality.<br/>
The ExFlow Copilot is tailored to fit and enhance the workflow of ExFlow customers.<br/>
 
The two parts that make up the form summaries are status and insights. Each tailored for the respective form.<br/>

On record level, the status will highlight actions made on the invoice and display relevant details that usually require scrolling or switching page. This includes status, matching policies, how many approvers added to the invoice compared to how many required and who is currently working with the invoice. On list level, it will instead highlight number and amounts for different invoice types and provide an friendly interface to check the invoice backlog.<br/>
 
The insights parts are a high-level summarization of invoices that require extra attention. This includes number and amounts for overdue invoices, non-final posted invoices and invoices that was final posted after due date.<br/>
On record level, this functionality highlights the same information for the vendor connected to the active invoice.<br/>
 
In My vendor invoices the ExFlow Insights will promote relevant invoice information for the specific user, such as what type and how many invoices need approval.<br/>
 
**Forms that currently supports the summarization capabilities:**<br/>
- Import Form, record and list level<br/>
- Document form, record and list level<br/>
- My vendor invoices, workspace level<br/>

### Activation of the feature
