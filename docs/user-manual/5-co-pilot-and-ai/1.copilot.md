We have improved and added new options for the Machine Learning service and functions within ExFlow AP and ExFlow Web.<br/>
From ExFlow release 2.16 we have introduced ExFlow Copilot, including Copilot Summaries on ExFlow AP forms,<br/> 
such as the import form and the document form.<br/>
ExFlow Copilot is developed to provide additional status and insights and a consistent look and feel for end-users.<br/>
This first version will be released as a separate module.<br/>
