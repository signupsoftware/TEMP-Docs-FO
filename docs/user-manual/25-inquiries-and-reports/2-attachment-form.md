ExFlow \| Inquiries and reports \| Attachment form

When you have attachments imported related to a specific invoice i.e. for Danish utility statements, they are usually imported after the invoice has arrived. From this form you can easily connect the attachment to the invoice.

**Note! This form does not show attachments added within ExFlow or ExFlow web.**
