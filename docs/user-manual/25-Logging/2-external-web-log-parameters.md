ExFlow \| Logging

This function can be switched on to log all the web calls from ExFlow web into D365 and which messages are sent back to the ExFlow web. This is not an audit log function; it is purely used to conduct a trace to find out if something is wrong in the ExFlow web without having to start the logging for ExFlow web from inside the Azure web installation. This function is only used by SignUp Software AB or other ExFlow partner's support personnel.
