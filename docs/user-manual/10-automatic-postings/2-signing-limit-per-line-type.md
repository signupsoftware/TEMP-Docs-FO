ExFlow \| Setup \| References \| Signing limit per line type

Signing limits per line type can be seen as an extension of the standard signing limit function in D365FO. If this function is used, ExFlow will first check if there is a signing limit for the line type of "Invoice". If, for example, a row has the line type "Item" as can be seen in the image below it will be used instead of the "standard" signing limit that is set up in D365 Organization administration.
