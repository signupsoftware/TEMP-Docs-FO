<div class="sow-header">SERVICES</div>
<br/>
The Supplier undertakes to assist the Customer in the implementation of the Software in the Customer's environment by providing the following Implementation Services at the price set out in the Agreement. 
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Planning Meeting</div>
The Supplier will arrange a meeting where the structure of the Implementation Services will be discussed with the Customer and/or BC partner.
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Technical Preparations</div>
The Supplier will send a guide detailing the technical requirements and collect technical information impacting the project. 
The customer will ensure that the software is installed and activated within one of their Microsoft Dynamics sandbox environments. If the Customer requires the Software to be installed on more than one environment, such services will be provided at the Supplier's Consultancy Services rate specified in the Agreement.
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Startup Workshop</div>
The Supplier will arrange a startup meeting for the Customer's implementation project team. The purpose of the workshop is to go through the solution in detail to gather information for making the system setup and identify any potential gaps. 
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Configuration</div>
The Supplier will assist the Customer in completing the parameter setup for one (1) company. If the Customer requires assistance with setting up additional companies, such assistance will be provided at the Supplier's Consultancy Services rate specified in the Agreement. 
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Training</div>
The Supplier will arrange one (1) training session for the Customer's users responsible for accounts payable. If order matching is included in the Agreement an additional training session will be scheduled.
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Go Live Prep</div>
The Supplier will import ExFlow settings from the test environment to the production environment before Go Live.
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">Project Management</div>
Project management services are included in the price for the Implementation Services, up until Go Live.
<br/><br/><div class="sow-header-smaller">CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS</div>
The Supplier's delivery of the Implementation Services is dependent on the Customer actively participating in the implementation process and offering reasonable assistance. The Customer will therefore be required to: 
<ul type="disc">
<li>Designate a project leader within the Customer's organization who will be responsible for allocating resources, managing work related to the implementation of the Software, and serving as the primary point of contact for all interactions with the Supplier.</li>
<br/>
<li>Establish a remote connection to enable the Supplier's access to the Customer's environment.</li>
<br/>
<li>If parties other than the Supplier implement the OCR software or any other invoice data transport stream, the Customer is responsible for ensuring that the data is adapted to the Supplier's specified format. If the Customer requires assistance with the format, such assistance will be provided at the Consultancy Services rate specified in the Agreement.</li>
<br/>
<li>Ensure that sufficiently qualified personnel from the Customer's organization are available throughout the implementation and testing phases.</li>
<br/>
<li>Promptly notify the Supplier of any defects in the Software or its implementation discovered during the Customer's acceptance testing.</li>
<br/>
<li>Conduct testing and accept delivery of the Software.  Approval of the delivery is a prerequisite before the Supplier can make the Software available in the Customer's production environment. Customer approval will be documented during a Go Live approval meeting held jointly with the Supplier, following the successful completion of acceptance testing for the Software in the Customer's test environment.</li>
</ul>
